so basically, There is brute force and there is the pointer sol


[2, 7, 11, 15]

l = 2
r = 15

l + r > t

l + r = t

l + r < t


[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11]

target = 9


l = 1
r = 11

1 + 11 = 12 > 9 
r = r - 1


l = 1
r = 7

l + r = 8 < 9
l = l + 1;


l = 3
r = 7

l + r = 10 > 9
r = r - 1


l = 3 
r = 5
l + r = 8 < 9

l = l + 1
