1. [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]

When mid is part of the left sorted array {7 is part of the left sorted array
[4, 5, 6, 7]}

3 cases:

t = 5
target < mid
r = mid - 1

t = 0
target < left
l = mid + 1


t = 2
target > mid
l = mid + 1



2. [6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5]

when mid is part of the right sorted array {1 is a part of the right sorted array
[0 ,1 , 2, 4, 5]}

3 cases:

t = 7
target > right
r = mid - 1

t = 4
target > mid
l = mid + 1

t = 0
r = mid - 1
