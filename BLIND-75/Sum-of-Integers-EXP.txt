2 + 3

2->      0010 -> a
3->      0011 -> b

a^b    (0)0001 -> a
a&b(<<1)0010(0)  -> b

 0001
0010

a^b  -> 00101 -> 5

Since our new b starts with a zero after shifting to left,
      we will end the loop. If it were to start from '1',
      we were to conintue the loop and continue doing this
      same shit again and again till we get the start of variable
      b(which is the result of a&b).
