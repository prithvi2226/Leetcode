Basically, we are using a DP solution

so, what we wll do is 

we have an array

{7, 5, 1}

and we have to make 18 out of these coins 


				18
			{7, 5, 1}
			/	|	\		
		   11  13   17
	{7, 5, 1}{7, 5, 1}{7, 5, 1}
	/	|  \  /  |  \  /  |  \
	4   6  10 6  8  12 10 12  16


THE function will keep going regardless and and compares itself with the last recursive answer
And it will return the minimum of those two
